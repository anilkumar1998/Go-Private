This is a chrome extension to open current tab in incognito mode.

Most people read [Medium](https://medium.com). It stores the cookies in the browser and keep a count on how many stories we read in the site. For a free member, only 3 premium stories can be read. 

So to overcome this we can simply copy the url and paste it in incognito mode. As incognito doesn't store cookies, we can read any number of premium stories.

To simply this process of copying the url and opening the incognito mode and pasting it. This chrome extension on a single click opens the current tab url in the incognito window.

For using this extension, you just need to following steps:
1. Clone this repository
2. Go to chrome
3. Go to extensions (chrome://extensions/)
4. Enable developer mode
5. Click on Load unpacked
6. Give the cloned folder

Now you are all set.

Future work:
1. When we click on extension in tools bar, we will get a pop up having button. Need to make this UI better.
2. Need to give an option in the UI to close the current tab after opening it in incognito. (Default should be 'NO')
3. Instead of clicking on the extension and then on the button, incognito window should appear when clicked on extension itself.
4. Make a shortcut for the extension (i.e., when this keyboard shortcut is used, incognito window should appear)


** Feel free to give suggestions on the code (or) future work etc **
